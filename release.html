						<b><i>11/2/2023 Build 2.0.031 110223</i></b><br>
						<ul>
							<u>Logic Fixes</u><br>
							<li>Fixed first chest of Hookshot cave in Inverted, without Hookshot, with a unique set of items</li>
							<li>Fixed first two chests upstairs in GT to be available in entrance modes with proper items</li>
							NOTE: This introduces some rare odd logic for possible items, which we are going to flag, but will fix at a later date
						</ul>					
						<b><i>9/11/2023 Build 2.0.030 091123</i></b><br>
						<ul>
							<u>Interface Changes</u><br>
							<li>Added jump to launcher button when selecting an archived preset from the dropdown menu</li>
							<li>Fixed a couple issues with sprites not loading due to naming</li>

						</ul>					
						<b><i>8/31/2023 Build 2.0.028 083123</i></b><br>
						<ul>
							<u>Interface Changes</u><br>
							<li>Updated button presets for ALTTPR Ladder Season Twenty Modes (<a href="https://alttprladder.com" target="_blank">https://alttprladder.com</a>)</li>
							Big thanks to Catobat for the following changes:<br>
							<li>Tracked data can now be exported as Customizer YAML files, in this way Overworld Shuffle plandos can be easily created. Note that these cannot be imported in the tracker again, save the tracker data separately instead if you want to modify anything later.</li>
							<li>Tracked data can now be saved to JSON files.</li>
							<li>Buttons for setting certain edges to vanilla have been moved to a new menu accessed through the "Bulk transition actions" button, new buttons have been added, and most of these can be applied when opening the tracker as part of entering the seed settings.</li>
							<li>Added support for Swapped Overworld Shuffle (not implemented in the randomizer yet).</li>
							<li>Added an option to always draw edges on the overworld map even if they are unshuffled.</li>
							<li>The Overworld Path Search has 2 new buttons to save a few clicks for example when starting a new path from the last target.</li>
							<li>When hovering over a screen or edges in certain modes, in addition to drawing lines to connected edges, the connected screens are outlined to make them easier to see.</li>
							<li>Fixed several issues with auto adjustments after changing mode settings.</li>
							<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
							<li>Fixed Arrghus boss shuffle kill conditions check</li>
						</ul>
						<b><i>7/29/2023 Build 2.0.027 062523</i></b><br>
						<ul>
							<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
							<li>Fixed inverted logic for Potion Shop access</li>
							<li>Fixed Shopsanity logic for DDM Shop</li>
						</ul>
						<b><i>6/25/2023 Build 2.0.026 062523</i></b><br>
						<ul>
							<u>Interface Changes</u><br>
							<li>Updated button presets for ALTTPR Ladder Season Nineteen Modes (<a href="https://alttprladder.com" target="_blank">https://alttprladder.com</a>)</li>
							<li>Fixed a few more stylesheet issues with sprites not loading</li>
							<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
							<li>Updated logic for Arrghus checks to also look for Bow and either Ice Rod or Fire Rod, or Ice Rod or Fire Rod and 2 Magic extensions (Bottles or Half Magic). Yes, this is a real thing.</li>
							<li>Added an issue to the Known Issues list, where the boss of Mire isn't accurately taking into account of a small key on the boss with a boss shuffle active, if the boss isn't killable. This is a bit more complex to fix, and we will look to correct this in a future release.</li>
						</ul>
						<b><i>4/20/2023 Build 2.0.025 042023</i></b><br>
						<ul>

							<li>Updated archive presets with additional modes</li>
							<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
							<li>Fixed logic issue in ToH with non-small key shuffle and available chests</li>
							<li>We have identified the area where sometimes, with the Ambrosia flag active, the tracker will show 'Possible' instead of 'Available', even though the dungeon logic requires item checks to force items into certain locations (ie: IP). This has been added to the Known Issues report, but likely won't be fixed without a re-write of the Ambrosia functionality.</li>
						</ul>

							<li>Added support for Free Terrain</li>
							<li>Added support for Decoupled Overworld</li>
							<li>Overhauled the behavior for after changing mode settings later on (like in Mystery) and the automatic transition adjustments the tracker then offers you to do. The text and button for these adjustments are only displayed if there actually are changes that would happen. It can provide a list of what types of changes would happen, for example if any edges that are invalid in the current mode would get deleted, or if any edges will be deduced from the mode or already tracked edges. All of this can also be accessed through a new button on the full overworld map for convenience.</li>
							<li>Overhauled the controls under the overworld map while a transition is selected. The names of the selected transition and all currently connected transitions are now displayed. Hovering over any "Disconnect" buttons or names of connected transitions will highlight the corresponding line(s) on the map. A button was added to allow whirlpools to loop with themselves in Whirlpool Shuffle.</li>
							<li>Changed the interface for syncing the tracker with the main window and added a setting for the default sync type when the tracker window is opened</li>

							<li>Added buttons at the bottom of the Overworld Tracking page for setting all horizontal or all vertical edges to vanilla or deleting all edges and screen states</li>

						<ul>
							Thanks to Catobat for the following changes:<br>
							<u>Interface Changes</u><br>
							<li>In Mystery, when switching between Entrance and Non-Entrance (or World State in Entrance mode), the page no longer reloads. This means item tracking progress is no longer lost and it no longer causes disconnects with the Overworld Tracking window or Autotracking.</li>
							<li>In Mystery, it is now possible to change the Door Shuffle, Overworld Shuffle and Shopsanity settings</li>
							<li>The Dungeon and Overworld Tracking window now automatically saves and loads display settings. More customization options will be added in the future.</li>
							<li>Overworld paths that were generated by a search now have a "Repeat search" button that allows for later repeating of a search with the same search settings.</li>
							<li>When Overworld Tracking is synced with the main window, a new button assists in changing World State and Entrance Shuffle in case those were not set correctly from the start.</li>
							<li>Updated sprites from 31.0.11</li>
							<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
							<li>Certain mode combinations will automatically mark Sanctuary (or Dark Chapel) as a common starting location when beginning.</li>

						<ul>
							Thanks to Catobat for the following changes to the Overworld Tracker:<br>
							<u>Interface Changes</u><br>
							<li>The full overworld map can now also be used directly on the main Overworld Tracking page</li>
							<li>Paths are now viewable on the overworld map</li>
							<li>When opening the Overworld and Dungeon Tracker window for the first time, you are now immediately asked to either select all the mode settings and whether they might still change later, or load saved data to continue a previous session. Mystery mode is also available which simply sets all mode settings to the least restrictive options for the start.</li>
							<li>The Overworld Path Search UI has been completely overhauled and now has a clearer distinction between and indication of start and target points</li>
							<li>More Overworld Path Search options (selecting a single region on the starting screen, how common starts can be used when a specific starting screen is selected, followers, and mirror portals (only at start or target regions)) When you are about to start a new search and asked about the target screen, you can now also select a search preset for commonly needed paths that may involve more than just selecting a target screen, like delivering the purple chest to the thief.</li>
							<li>Below the Overworld Path Search, there is now a checklist that provides some quick tips on what may be missing if a path could not be found</li>
							<li>When selecting a screen on the full overworld map, the buttons for adding a common start region can now also be used to remove already existing ones</li>
							<li>Easier screen swapping in Mixed with an option to keep marked transitions in the same world as before the swap</li>
							<li>In Mystery, when changing certain settings in the main tracker window that force a disconnection between the two tracker windows, a warning and explanation on how to reconnect the tracker windows is now displayed. The main page also starts showing a warning and the same explanation (this also happens if the connection is lost in some other way).</li>
							<li>Fixed a bug where Castle Tower wasn't visually moved to Death Mountain in Inverted with Door Shuffle</li>
							<li>Setting the flute spots in Flute Shuffle gives you the option to disable Flute Shuffle</li>

							<li>Updated sprite list, fixed outstanding missing sprites</li>
							<li>Added a status indicator for Autotracking status in the bottom right corner of the map tracker</li>
							NOTE: Because of lack of space, there is no spot left on the item tracker for this indicator for this feature, so unless you are using the map tracker, this feature will not be available
						</ul>

							<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
							<li>Changed logic for GT entry in Mystery Modes, for when crystal requirement is unknown, entry will be marked as possible instead of unavailable if GT is reachable</li>

						<b><i>5/24/2021 Build 1.6.016 052421</i></b><br>
						<ul>
							<u>Interface Changes</u><br>
							<li>Big thanks to Catobat for the following updates:</li>
							<li>Added Overworld Shuffle tracking support which is located in the Dungeon Tracker window</li>
							<li>Made some improvements to the Dungeon Tracker window including an optional sidebar for quick switching between dungeons (or dungeon and overworld)</li>

							<li>Fixed locations reachable via Flute activations in inverted entrance</u>
							<li>Fixed King's Tomb opening in inverted entrance</u>
							<li>Made locations in SW/Outcast area reachable always with Moon Pearl and back of SW entrance located</u><br>
								NOTE: This is a reversion from a previous change. Where it is possible to get locked behind the one entrance and drop that you can access, it is always much more likely that it will be available. Be aware that this entrance may be one sided and you cannot progress through the single door, although unlikely. This will require the use of "Possible" entrances, which is currently not a feature. We will work on adding this in the future.<br>

						<ul>
							<u>Interface Changes</u><br>
							<li>Numerous updates to the launcher!</li>
							Updated the Logic Settings to include individual Shuffled Items for wild maps, compasses, small keys, and big keys<br>
							NOTE: The Dungeon Items selector works to fill in presets, but it is no longer used beyond the launcher as each individual setting is now looked at for logic.<br>
							Added Ambrosia to the logic settings, to always check for the last item in each dungeon when only one item remains<br>
							Added Starting Items to the launcher, which is more for the presets and imports, but it will carry over to the tracker if you preset it (NOTE: If you use a preset with starting boots, like Open Boots, and then change up other flags, the boots will already be preset and you cannot uncheck it without using a different preset. This is NOT a bug, but an annoyance. Just uncheck them when you launch, and this will be addressed at a later time.)<br>
							Removed Advanced/Basic difficulty settings, as it will no longer be looked at and all modes will be considered as advanced placement<br>
							Added (FINALLY) an instructions document from the launcher, which explains all of the various modes and how to use the tracker in general<br><br>
							<li>Updated up the presets for ALTTPR Ladder Season Four Modes! (<a href="https://alttprladder.com" target="_blank">https://alttprladder.com</a>) </li>
							<li>For those that have the ability to use it, there is a new auto tracking module added for items and locations! Just have it selected on the Launcher. Big shout-out to Bonta for providing the module to make this work! NOTE: The default websocket port that is being used is 8080.</li>
							<li>Overworld Glitches logic has been added! Big thanks to Coxla for adding it! It hasn't been fully tested, so please report any issues. Major/No Logic will always show all locations, as logic there is not yet implemented. (Nor likely will it ever)</li>
							<li>Added a map icon whenever Wild Maps are live, which is at the end of the rotation, and accessible by right clicking on pendant/crystal rotator when it is at the start (?)</li>
							<li>Right clicking on medallions for MM and TR will now navigate backward</li>

						<b><i>1/18/2020 Build 1.5.012 011820</i></b><br>
						<ul>
							<u>Mode Changes</u><br>
							<li>Thanks to Catobat to contributing a new toggle for tracking door rando! This adds additional chest and key info for tracking individual pieces of dungeons, which also does open up new considerations, like small keys in EP, or the bomb hole in TT. Currently, there is no logic built to track what could be available within the dungeons and what chests could be accessed logically, as there really isn't a good way to tell the tracker what is and what isn't available. So the mode may look a little bit different.</li>
							<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
							<li>Small logical fixes for enemizer combinations</li>
						</ul>

							<li>Compact map now has entrance and full mystery options available! Big thanks to Catobat for making these changes! The compact map may still be a little hard to read at times...but what can ya do with that space? We will work on ways of improving the visual aspect to improve visibility.</li>
						</ul>
						<b><i>12/22/2019 Build 1.5.009 122219</i></b><br>

						</ul>
						<b><i>12/08/2019 Build 1.5.007 120819</i></b><br>

							<li>Fixed swordless bug for entry into MM/TR/IP</li>
						</ul>
						<b><i>12/04/2019 Build 1.5.006 120419</i></b><br>
						<ul>
							<u>Interface Changes</u><br>
							<li>Moved Mystery settings flag to the main interface and changed so the tracker does not auto-load on a preset setting, but instead goes to the display settings at the bottom</li>
							<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
							<li>Modified the Ice Palace boss logic to once again allow for possible completion without Hookshot or Somaria</li>
							NOTE: I've gone back and forth with this logic, as it makes no actual sense. However, there are situations where you can force the old vanilla route with keys up front where hook and cane are not actually required. Also note, that in full keysanity mode, it will still return an unavailable (red) for the boss when you don't have hook, cane, or the big key. Chest logic remains unchanged.<br><br>
							<li>Fixed issue where hammer was required for low crystal count GT for chests</li>
							<li>Fixed a map tracking update issue where crystals and pendants are swapped, not affecting map tracking for GT entry and Ganon vulnerability until a refresh has occurred</li>
						</ul>
						<b><i>12/02/2019 Build 1.5.005 120219</i></b><br>

						</ul>
						<b><i>12/01/2019 Build 1.5.004a 120119</i></b><br>
						<ul>
							<u>Mode Changes</u><br>
							<li>Because everybody loves a good mystery, a new Mystery Seed preset has been added! This will allow you to switch between modes in a mystery race (They are ALLLLLL the rage these days) whenever you figure out one of the flags. Doing so will load the default settings: Open, non-Entrance, Boss + Enemy Shuffle, Keysanity, Ganon w/ Random-Random. When in Mystery Seed mode, a new flag icon will appear in the top left under the Ganon Vulnerable icon. Simply click on it, change what settings you want, and save and the adjustments should occur. Note, that if you switch between Entrance and non-Entrance, you will lose all of your tracked items and map locations. If you switch between Inverted and non-Inverted, you will lose your map tracking locations.</li>
							NOTE: Entrance mode is not supported with compact map and thus, you cannot switch between them<br><br>
							<li>Added basic "glitched" tracking, which is basically just everything is on for now without any logic built in, so the modes are currently condensed into one. When proper logic is added later, those will be split back out again.</li>
							<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
							<li>Numerous entrance logic fixes</li>
							<li>Fixed back of escape chests in retro not showing available with lantern</li>
							<li>Fixed inverted keysanity check with Castle Tower showing available when it should be dark accessible only</li>
							<li>Fixed inverted keysanity SP boss check without small key showing available</li>
							<li>Fixed unlikely scenario where SP items were showing possible, but no actual way to get to SP, after AGA1 kill</li>
						</ul>

						</ul>
						<b><i>11/20/2019 Build 1.5.002 112019</i></b><br>
						<ul>
							<u>Interface Changes</u><br>
							<li>Updated entrance interface to allow for multiple entrances (up to 3) to be connected to a single location</li>
							NOTE: This changes how the connector addition interface works, and you now need to go to the right click menu to connect and disconnect locations. Having the on screen icon to add was too troublesome with the new multi-entrance logic build. All entrance adds and disconnects will now be handled from this menu. The old connect button on the map has been removed and the disconnect will only be visible when needing to cancel a location. That space will be replaced by the soon-to-have Summary Page, which will show you a summary of all known locations.<br><br>
							<li>Added a small note indicator when a note is active on a location, although other on-screen items always have priority (So the note icon may be hidden)</li>
							<li>Updated the hover-over caption to give more complete information</li>
							<li>Modified key locations in conjunction with connectors, allowing both connectors and key locations to be on one item; Key location color schemes will always get priority in this case</li>
							<li>Updated the right click menu to better summarize the location details</li>

						<b><i>11/16/2019 Build 1.5.001 111619</i></b><br>
						<ul>
							<u>Interface Changes</u><br>
							<li>Changed the default item tracker, added bombs, half magic, and AGA 2, and split some items to share one spot</li>
							Explanation: Okay, I feel like I need to explain this one. The core of this revolves around needing AGA 2 as a clickable option, because entrance and non-fast Ganon modes require clearing AGA 2, but not always when you are ready to finish the game. So making the split spot for AGA 1 and AGA 2 was natural. However, there has been a push by some of the community to make the tracker match the in-game menu, which meant adding...sigh...Bombs. (Editors note: YOU ALWAYS HAVE BOMBS!!) In order to do that, it required merging Mushroom/Powder and Shovel/Flute spots. The deciding factor in all of this, is that it allowed the addition of Half Magic, something which I have been wanting for a while, because there is some logic that runs from it. (NOTE: That logic has yet to be implemented in this release, and it is limited to basic item placement modes, so it will come later) So, hopefully this should make MOST people happy.<br><br>
							<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
							<li>Added logic for non-inverted entrance mode! Be aware, in order to properly use it, you will need to make connectors to the areas that you need access to. For example, you need to make a valid connection to Death Mountain for the logic to recognize it. Also, this logic is still in the validation phase, so please report any issues!</li>
							<li>Fixed bug in medallion checks</li>

						<b><i>10/14/2019 Build 1.4.001 101419</i></b><br>
						<ul>
							<u>Mode Changes</u><br>
							<li>Basic entrance tracking has been added!<br>
								This is going to be the first of several releases of Entrance, as we are going to roll it out slowly. This first initial build has no built in logic behind the entrances. Just the locations, the ability to check off locations, tag known locations, make connections, and add notes. The next major builds will improve and clean up the interface, the ability to properly track available dungeon chests, followed by logic.<br>
								Currently, if you left click on a diamond (entrance), it will simply check it off, the way that chests currently do. However, if you right click on it, it will bring up the options for the entrance. You can click a known location, which will highlight it, and/or add a note. Any known locations or notes will show up in the caption area under the map.<br>
								To add a connector, click at the connector button near the bottom right area of the light world map.  Then click on the two entrances you want to connect, and they should highlight that they are active. Hovering over them will show where they are connected in the caption area, or you can view the details on the right click menu. That is where you can remove the connector as well, it will show a Disconnect button. Also, if you want to view the lines of the connector, you can do so by clicking on the Eye button in the bottom left hand corner of the dark world map.  You can re-hide them by pressing the button again.<br>
								Also, for the entrance version of the map, there are no dungeon indicators on the map (because the dungeon could be anywhere!). As stated before, we will update this with a new method to track chests in a future release.<br>
								As always, please report any issues, thank you!<br>

						<ul>
							<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
							<li>Updated Ice Palace boss logic<br>
								This logic is going to be one of those exceptions to the rules, in regards to what is "required" vs what is "expected". This may change down the road, but as it stands, it basically requires the Hookshot or Somaria and the big key (in full keysanity mode), although that does not exactly fit what the logic says.<br>

						</ul>
						<b><i>9/26/2019 Build 1.3.007 092619</i></b><br>
						<ul>
							<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
							<li>Finalized rebuilding all of the dungeon logic for all available modes<br>
								As per the previous announcement, there were several changes to the logic structure in regards to small keys in order to handle the new MCS shuffle mode. Because of this, the entire way that chest logic is handled was redesigned. There are chances that some logic issues slipped through testing, and if you discover any, please let Dunka know via Discord @ @bigdunka.<br>
								Logic was redesigned to more closely match what is in the randomizer seeding and placement logic. Because of this, areas like Ice Palace, where the tracker would previously show available via bomb jump, that has since been removed and the bomb jump is no longer in logic. Other areas, like Turtle Rock with small key shuffle, were redesigned to allow for max potential items for keys by logic, which means it will not count skipping the vanilla big key location with only 3 small keys, making the boss not killable.<br>
								Other areas went outside of the logic, with regards to availability of killing bosses. If a boss is killable, but the dungeon is not fully clearable, it will show that the boss can be defeated, even if the logic states that it shouldn't be. Other areas that were adjusted with for getting items "smartly" and showing possibilities. PoD is an example, with being able to full clear all items and the boss with just five small keys, as long as you use the hammer and bow to not open the front door. These logically are marked as possible on the map, but will not show fully available without all six keys.<br>
								Long story short: Please use the map tracker with the understanding that it is based off the logic and you can use your knowledge of the game to bypass this logic, the same way you could use a sequence break to get items you should not.<br>
								<br>

							<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
							<li>Continued work on IP, TR, and GT logic, and a more simplified way to track items in all dungeons</li>
							<u>Mode Changes</u><br>
							<li>Enabled Enemy Shuffle, which is important to complete some dungeons (ie: Possibly completing Eastern Palace without the bow without having to fight the red Eyegores)</li>
							<li>Enabled Item Placement, which for this tracker, is only important for dark rooms with torches being in logic with Fire Rod (Not all logic has been entered and tested)</li>
							<u>Misc Changes</u><br>
							<li>Adjusted the styles to make chests larger when small and big keys are not being tracked, to eliminate un-used space</li>

						</ul>
						<b><i>9/16/2019 Build 1.3.002 091619a</i></b><br>
						<ul>
							<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
							<li>Fixed a few boss requirements to add in more obscure items that can kill bosses in logic</li>
							<u>Mode Changes</u><br>
							<li>Combined modes for Boss and Enemy Shuffle to be either on or off, as logic does not change based off those flags (Any flags that can be condensed is good!)</li>
							<li>Enabled Open Tower and Ganon Vulnerable flags. The user will be given an icon in the top left hand corner to click on to set the known requirements if the requirements are random.</li>
						</ul>
						<b><i>9/16/2019 Build 1.3.001 091619</i></b><br>
						<ul>
							<li>First major release for v31!<br>
							<li>Complete overhaul of launcher to show all available flags, and several that will be released in the future, including entrance!<br>
							<li>Updated all sub-page interfaces and stylesheets<br>
							<li>Overhaul of logic to match new v31 options<br>
								NOTICE: There will be several incremental updates once v31 is formally released. We are basing the logic off what limited information has been released to this point. Please be sure to report any issues when you find them and we will make an updated list on the Known Issues page.<br>
							<li>Removed "known easy sequence breaks" to line up the general logic, but continue to allow "common sense" sequence breaks<br>
								To expand on this, the original tracker always had Ice Palace built in with a possible sequence break with the bomb jump. That has since been removed and the notation in the comments also removed. If you do not have the Hookshot or Somaria, Ice Palace will show as not completable. This is because there are going to be new flags in the logic to allow for certain glitches to be auto-populated and the previous logic would override that.<br>
								Other common sense logic, however, has not been removed. For example, in Full Shuffle, Desert Palace is not completable by logic without both the big key and the small key, to prevent a potential small key lock. However, if you have the big key and not the small key, the tracker will show that the dungeon boss is indeed killable. This is to allow for ease of recognition of clearable dungeons while in go mode.<br>
							<li>Added a new purple color coded map tracker function for "Dark Room Possible". The current color codes are now as follows:<br>
								Red = Unavailable<br>
								Green = Available<br>
								Yellow = Possible<br>
								Blue = Dark Room Available<br>
								Purple = Dark Room Possible<br>
							<li>Right clicking on crystal/pendant icons will go backwards, making for faster crystal selection<br>
							<li>This release is assuming Basic Item Placement, which means required items are using the v30 logic (Laser Bridge for example still requires a safety). Advanced logic will be added in a future release.<br>
							<li>Entrance Shuffle, Enemy Shuffle, Glitches, Item Placement, Open Tower, Ganon Vulnerable, and Spoiler Log settings are currently disabled, pending more development and validation</li>
