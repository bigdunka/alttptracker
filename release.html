			<h2>Latest Changes:</h2>
			<div class="releaseDiv">
				<b><i>1/24/2021 Build 1.6.012 012421</i></b><br>
				<ul>
					<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
					<li>Fixed Hera basement chest in key shuffled modes</u>
					<li>Fixed several OWG logic issues</u>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="releaseDiv">
				<b><i>1/17/2021 Build 1.6.011 011721</i></b><br>
				<ul>
					<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
					<li>Fixed locations reachable via Flute activations in inverted entrance</u>
					<li>Fixed King's Tomb opening in inverted entrance</u>
					<li>Made locations in SW/Outcast area reachable always with Moon Pearl and back of SW entrance located</u><br>
					NOTE: This is a reversion from a previous change. Where it is possible to get locked behind the one entrance and drop that you can access, it is always much more likely that it will be available. Be aware that this entrance may be one sided and you cannot progress through the single door, although unlikely. This will require the use of "Possible" entrances, which is currently not a feature. We will work on adding this in the future.<br>

				<b><i>10/18/2020 Build 1.6.001 101820</i></b><br>
				<ul>
					<u>Interface Changes</u><br>
					<li>Numerous updates to the launcher!</li>
					Updated the Logic Settings to include individual Shuffled Items for wild maps, compasses, small keys, and big keys<br>
					NOTE: The Dungeon Items selector works to fill in presets, but it is no longer used beyond the launcher as each individual setting is now looked at for logic.<br>
					Added Ambrosia to the logic settings, to always check for the last item in each dungeon when only one item remains<br>
					Added Starting Items to the launcher, which is more for the presets and imports, but it will carry over to the tracker if you preset it (NOTE: If you use a preset with starting boots, like Open Boots, and then change up other flags, the boots will already be preset and you cannot uncheck it without using a different preset. This is NOT a bug, but an annoyance. Just uncheck them when you launch, and this will be addressed at a later time.)<br>
					Removed Advanced/Basic difficulty settings, as it will no longer be looked at and all modes will be considered as advanced placement<br>
					Added (FINALLY) an instructions document from the launcher, which explains all of the various modes and how to use the tracker in general<br><br>
					<li>Updated up the presets for ALTTPR Ladder Season Four Modes! (<a href="https://alttprladder.com" target="_blank">https://alttprladder.com</a>) </li><br>
					<li>For those that have the ability to use it, there is a new auto tracking module added for items and locations! Just have it selected on the Launcher. Big shout-out to Bonta for providing the module to make this work! NOTE: The default websocket port that is being used is 8080.</li><br>
					<li>Overworld Glitches logic has been added! Big thanks to Coxla for adding it! It hasn't been fully tested, so please report any issues. Major/No Logic will always show all locations, as logic there is not yet implemented. (Nor likely will it ever)</li><br>
					<li>Added a map icon whenever Wild Maps are live, which is at the end of the rotation, and accessible by right clicking on pendant/crystal rotator when it is at the start (?)</li><br>
					<li>Right clicking on medallions for MM and TR will now navigate backward</li><br>
				</ul>

					<li>New location note feature has been added! If you right click on a location, it will allow you to select an item, which will then leave a note (hover to see it below the map in the caption area) on the location so you remember to go back for it later.

				<b><i>1/18/2020 Build 1.5.012 011820</i></b><br>
				<ul>
					<u>Mode Changes</u><br>
					<li>Thanks to Catobat to contributing a new toggle for tracking door rando! This adds additional chest and key info for tracking individual pieces of dungeons, which also does open up new considerations, like small keys in EP, or the bomb hole in TT. Currently, there is no logic built to track what could be available within the dungeons and what chests could be accessed logically, as there really isn't a good way to tell the tracker what is and what isn't available. So the mode may look a little bit different.</li><br>
					<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
					<li>Small logical fixes for enemizer combinations</li><br>
				</ul>

			<div class="releaseDiv">
				<b><i>1/2/2020 Build 1.5.011 010220</i></b><br>

				</ul>

					<u>Interface Changes</u><br>
					<li>Compact map now has entrance and full mystery options available! Big thanks to Catobat for making these changes! The compact map may still be a little hard to read at times...but what can ya do with that space? We will work on ways of improving the visual aspect to improve visibility.</li><br>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="releaseDiv">
				<b><i>12/22/2019 Build 1.5.009 122219</i></b><br>

			<div class="releaseDiv">
				<b><i>12/10/2019 Build 1.5.008 121019</i></b><br>
				<ul>
					<u>Interface Changes</u><br>
					<li>Added starting zones for Entrance for Link's House, Sanctuary, and Death Mountain</li><br>
					<li>Modified tag locations for areas near the north of the map to show under the location tab instead of over, to prevent it falling off the screen</li><br>
					<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
					<li>Applied already live hotfix for new swordless bug</li><br>
				</ul>

			<div class="releaseDiv">

				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="releaseDiv">
				<b><i>12/04/2019 Build 1.5.006 120419</i></b><br>
				<ul>
					<u>Interface Changes</u><br>
					<li>Moved Mystery settings flag to the main interface and changed so the tracker does not auto-load on a preset setting, but instead goes to the display settings at the bottom</li><br>
					<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
					<li>Modified the Ice Palace boss logic to once again allow for possible completion without Hookshot or Somaria</li><br>
					NOTE: I've gone back and forth with this logic, as it makes no actual sense. However, there are situations where you can force the old vanilla route with keys up front where hook and cane are not actually required. Also note, that in full keysanity mode, it will still return an unavailable (red) for the boss when you don't have hook, cane, or the big key. Chest logic remains unchanged.<br><br>
					<li>Fixed issue where hammer was required for low crystal count GT for chests</li><br>
					<li>Fixed a map tracking update issue where crystals and pendants are swapped, not affecting map tracking for GT entry and Ganon vulnerability until a refresh has occurred</li><br>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="releaseDiv">
				<b><i>12/02/2019 Build 1.5.005 120219</i></b><br>
				<ul>
					<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
					<li>A few new entrance logic fixes</li><br>
					<li>Fixed a bug in retro mode where SP was looking for non-retro small keys to complete</li><br>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="releaseDiv">
				<b><i>12/01/2019 Build 1.5.004a 120119</i></b><br>
				<ul>
					<u>Mode Changes</u><br>
					<li>Because everybody loves a good mystery, a new Mystery Seed preset has been added! This will allow you to switch between modes in a mystery race (They are ALLLLLL the rage these days) whenever you figure out one of the flags. Doing so will load the default settings: Open, non-Entrance, Boss + Enemy Shuffle, Keysanity, Ganon w/ Random-Random. When in Mystery Seed mode, a new flag icon will appear in the top left under the Ganon Vulnerable icon. Simply click on it, change what settings you want, and save and the adjustments should occur. Note, that if you switch between Entrance and non-Entrance, you will lose all of your tracked items and map locations. If you switch between Inverted and non-Inverted, you will lose your map tracking locations.</li><br>
					NOTE: Entrance mode is not supported with compact map and thus, you cannot switch between them<br><br>
					<li>Added basic "glitched" tracking, which is basically just everything is on for now without any logic built in, so the modes are currently condensed into one. When proper logic is added later, those will be split back out again.</li><br>
					<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
					<li>Numerous entrance logic fixes</li><br>
					<li>Fixed back of escape chests in retro not showing available with lantern</li><br>
					<li>Fixed inverted keysanity check with Castle Tower showing available when it should be dark accessible only</li><br>
					<li>Fixed inverted keysanity SP boss check without small key showing available</li><br>
					<li>Fixed unlikely scenario where SP items were showing possible, but no actual way to get to SP, after AGA1 kill</li><br>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="releaseDiv">
				<b><i>11/21/2019 Build 1.5.003 112119</i></b><br>
				<ul>
					<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
					<li>Fixed entrance known areas for dungeons not recognizing located</li><br>
					<li>Fixed entrance bug for lower EDM w/ hookshot and WDM access</li><br>
					<li>Added Dam location check for Dam underwater item and updated text</li><br>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="releaseDiv">
				<b><i>11/20/2019 Build 1.5.002 112019</i></b><br>
				<ul>
					<u>Interface Changes</u><br>
					<li>Updated entrance interface to allow for multiple entrances (up to 3) to be connected to a single location</li><br>
					NOTE: This changes how the connector addition interface works, and you now need to go to the right click menu to connect and disconnect locations. Having the on screen icon to add was too troublesome with the new multi-entrance logic build. All entrance adds and disconnects will now be handled from this menu. The old connect button on the map has been removed and the disconnect will only be visible when needing to cancel a location. That space will be replaced by the soon-to-have Summary Page, which will show you a summary of all known locations.<br><br>
					<li>Added a small note indicator when a note is active on a location, although other on-screen items always have priority (So the note icon may be hidden)</li><br>
					<li>Updated the hover-over caption to give more complete information</li><br>
					<li>Modified key locations in conjunction with connectors, allowing both connectors and key locations to be on one item; Key location color schemes will always get priority in this case</li><br>
					<li>Updated the right click menu to better summarize the location details</li><br>
					<li>Added temp location for Mystery Seed default settings, it is coming soon, which will give you the ability to update flags without reloading the tracker in mystery seeds!</li><br>
					<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
					<li>Fixed small logic issues with entrance logic</li><br>
				</ul>

			<div class="releaseDiv">
				<b><i>11/16/2019 Build 1.5.001 111619</i></b><br>
				<ul>
					<u>Interface Changes</u><br>
					<li>Changed the default item tracker, added bombs, half magic, and AGA 2, and split some items to share one spot</li><br>
					Explanation: Okay, I feel like I need to explain this one. The core of this revolves around needing AGA 2 as a clickable option, because entrance and non-fast Ganon modes require clearing AGA 2, but not always when you are ready to finish the game. So making the split spot for AGA 1 and AGA 2 was natural. However, there has been a push by some of the community to make the tracker match the in-game menu, which meant adding...sigh...Bombs. (Editors note: YOU ALWAYS HAVE BOMBS!!) In order to do that, it required merging Mushroom/Powder and Shovel/Flute spots. The deciding factor in all of this, is that it allowed the addition of Half Magic, something which I have been wanting for a while, because there is some logic that runs from it. (NOTE: That logic has yet to be implemented in this release, and it is limited to basic item placement modes, so it will come later) So, hopefully this should make MOST people happy.<br><br>
					<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
					<li>Added logic for non-inverted entrance mode! Be aware, in order to properly use it, you will need to make connectors to the areas that you need access to. For example, you need to make a valid connection to Death Mountain for the logic to recognize it. Also, this logic is still in the validation phase, so please report any issues!</li><br>
					<li>Fixed bug in medallion checks</li><br>

				<ul>
					<u>Mode Changes</u><br>
					<li>Basic entrance tracking has been added!<br>
					This is going to be the first of several releases of Entrance, as we are going to roll it out slowly. This first initial build has no built in logic behind the entrances. Just the locations, the ability to check off locations, tag known locations, make connections, and add notes. The next major builds will improve and clean up the interface, the ability to properly track available dungeon chests, followed by logic.<br>
					Currently, if you left click on a diamond (entrance), it will simply check it off, the way that chests currently do. However, if you right click on it, it will bring up the options for the entrance. You can click a known location, which will highlight it, and/or add a note. Any known locations or notes will show up in the caption area under the map.<br>
					To add a connector, click at the connector button near the bottom right area of the light world map.  Then click on the two entrances you want to connect, and they should highlight that they are active. Hovering over them will show where they are connected in the caption area, or you can view the details on the right click menu. That is where you can remove the connector as well, it will show a Disconnect button. Also, if you want to view the lines of the connector, you can do so by clicking on the Eye button in the bottom left hand corner of the dark world map.  You can re-hide them by pressing the button again.<br>
					Also, for the entrance version of the map, there are no dungeon indicators on the map (because the dungeon could be anywhere!). As stated before, we will update this with a new method to track chests in a future release.<br>
					As always, please report any issues, thank you!<br>

				<ul>
					<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
					<li>Updated Ice Palace boss logic<br>
					This logic is going to be one of those exceptions to the rules, in regards to what is "required" vs what is "expected". This may change down the road, but as it stands, it basically requires the Hookshot or Somaria and the big key (in full keysanity mode), although that does not exactly fit what the logic says.<br>

			<div class="releaseDiv">
				<b><i>9/26/2019 Build 1.3.007 092619</i></b><br>
				<ul>
					<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
					<li>Finalized rebuilding all of the dungeon logic for all available modes<br>
					As per the previous announcement, there were several changes to the logic structure in regards to small keys in order to handle the new MCS shuffle mode. Because of this, the entire way that chest logic is handled was redesigned. There are chances that some logic issues slipped through testing, and if you discover any, please let Dunka know via Discord @ BigDunka#8354.<br>
					Logic was redesigned to more closely match what is in the randomizer seeding and placement logic. Because of this, areas like Ice Palace, where the tracker would previously show available via bomb jump, that has since been removed and the bomb jump is no longer in logic. Other areas, like Turtle Rock with small key shuffle, were redesigned to allow for max potential items for keys by logic, which means it will not count skipping the vanilla big key location with only 3 small keys, making the boss not killable.<br>
					Other areas went outside of the logic, with regards to availability of killing bosses. If a boss is killable, but the dungeon is not fully clearable, it will show that the boss can be defeated, even if the logic states that it shouldn't be. Other areas that were adjusted with for getting items "smartly" and showing possibilities. PoD is an example, with being able to full clear all items and the boss with just five small keys, as long as you use the hammer and bow to not open the front door. These logically are marked as possible on the map, but will not show fully available without all six keys.<br>
					Long story short: Please use the map tracker with the understanding that it is based off the logic and you can use your knowledge of the game to bypass this logic, the same way you could use a sequence break to get items you should not.<br>
					<br>
					<u>Misc Changes</u><br>

					<li>Fixed a few boss requirements to add in more obscure items that can kill bosses in logic</li><br>

			</div>
			<div class="releaseDiv">
				<b><i>9/16/2019 Build 1.3.001 091619</i></b><br>
				<ul>
					<li>First major release for v31!<br>
					<li>Complete overhaul of launcher to show all available flags, and several that will be released in the future, including entrance!<br>
					<li>Updated all sub-page interfaces and stylesheets<br>
					<li>Overhaul of logic to match new v31 options<br>
					NOTICE: There will be several incremental updates once v31 is formally released. We are basing the logic off what limited information has been released to this point. Please be sure to report any issues when you find them and we will make an updated list on the Known Issues page.<br>
					<li>Removed "known easy sequence breaks" to line up the general logic, but continue to allow "common sense" sequence breaks<br>
					To expand on this, the original tracker always had Ice Palace built in with a possible sequence break with the bomb jump. That has since been removed and the notation in the comments also removed. If you do not have the Hookshot or Somaria, Ice Palace will show as not completable. This is because there are going to be new flags in the logic to allow for certain glitches to be auto-populated and the previous logic would override that.<br>
					Other common sense logic, however, has not been removed. For example, in Full Shuffle, Desert Palace is not completable by logic without both the big key and the small key, to prevent a potential small key lock. However, if you have the big key and not the small key, the tracker will show that the dungeon boss is indeed killable. This is to allow for ease of recognition of clearable dungeons while in go mode.<br>
					<li>Added a new purple color coded map tracker function for "Dark Room Possible". The current color codes are now as follows:<br>
					Red = Unavailable<br>
					Green = Available<br>
					Yellow = Possible<br>
					Blue = Dark Room Available<br>
					Purple = Dark Room Possible<br>
					<li>Right clicking on crystal/pendant icons will go backwards, making for faster crystal selection<br>
					<li>This release is assuming Basic Item Placement, which means required items are using the v30 logic (Laser Bridge for example still requires a safety). Advanced logic will be added in a future release.<br>
					<li>Entrance Shuffle, Enemy Shuffle, Glitches, Item Placement, Open Tower, Ganon Vulnerable, and Spoiler Log settings are currently disabled, pending more development and validation</li><br>
